		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<p>

				<li>1 lb ground pork (mince), (500g)</li>
				<li>2.5 cups Passata (tomato puree), (540g)</li>
				<li>3 tbsp tomato paste</li>
				<li>1 cups red wine, (250ml)</li>
				<li>6 cups beef stock, (1.5 litres)</li>
				<li>2 bay leaves</li>
				<li>1 tsp sea salt flakes and pepper</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Bechamel Sauce</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>5 tbsp butter, (70g)</li>
				<li>5 tbsp flour all-purpose, (70g)</li>
				<li>4 cups full fat milk, (1 litre)</li>
				<li>1/2 tsp nutmeg</li>
				<li>1 cup parmesan, freshly grated (70g)</li>
				<li>1 tsp sea salt and pepper</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Lasagne</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>1 lb fresh lasagna pasta sheets, (500g)</li>
				<li>2 balls mozzarella, (250g)</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<h2>Instructions</h2>
		<p>
			<h3>Ragu</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Finely chop the carrot, onion and celery and saute the vegetables gently in a 
					large frying pan with the olive oil. Once the vegetables are soft add the beef 
					and pork mince and cook until browned.</li>
				<li>If there is a lot of excess fat in the pan, spoon some out. Add the red wine 
					and reduce by half.</li>
				<li>Once the wine has reduced, add the passata (tomato puree), tomato paste, bay 
					leaves, 4 cups of beef stock (1 litre) and a pinch of salt and pepper.</li>
				<li>Stir everything together and leave to simmer on a low heat for 2.5-3 hours 
					uncovered. Add the rest of the beef stock half way through.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>Bechamel Sauce</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Add the butter to a saucepan and cook until melted and bubbling.</li>
				<li>Add the flour to the melted butter and stir to form a paste. Let the flour
					cook for 1 minute.</li>
				<li>Slowly whisk half of the milk into the butter and flour constantly whisking to
					avoid any lumps. Once it has started to thicken add the rest of the milk, nutmeg
					, parmesan and a pinch of salt and pepper.</li>
				<li>Continue to heat the sauce whilst stirring until thickened enough to coat the
					back of a wooden spoon. Take off the heat and set aside.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>Assemble the Lasagna</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Preheat the oven to 350F (180C).</li>
				<li>To assemble the lasagne, spoon a small amount of ragu on the very bottom of
					the baking dish. Top with and even layer of lasagna pasta sheets (cut the
					pasta sheets to fit your baking dish).</li>
				<li>Add a few more spoons of ragu so the pasta is completely covered followed by
					2 ladels of white sauce.</li>
				<li>Repeat the layers of pasta, ragu and bechamel sauce until everything is used
					up making sure to keep enough of bechamel sauce for the very top layer (you
					should have 4-5 layers of pasta).</li>
				<li>Cover the top layer of the lasagne with torn mozzarella and then bake in the
					oven for 45minutes or until bubbling and golden.</li>
				<li>Let it cool slightly for 5-10 minutes before serving.</li>
			</ol>
